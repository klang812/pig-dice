WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS 2 PLAYERS TO ROLL DICE FOR EACH PLAYER (IF DIE !== 1 && ==={2,3,4,5,6} add score) (if die === 1 score.toEqual(0) for that round)
if player decides to hold, player keeps total and adds to total score.
first player to total score.toEqual>=100, player wins! game over

turn score.toEqual()


Randomize which player should start?

--- Objects ---
Player() {
  Name
  Total score = 0
  Turn score = 0
}

--- Behaviors ---
rollDie {
  return a random value from 1 - 6
}

play {
  rollDie()
  if !== 1
    player's turn score += die value
  else
    turn score = 0
    "Your turn is over, next player's turn"
}

hold {
  turn score gets added to total score
  "Next player's turn"
  turn score = 0
  endGame()
}

initializeGame {
  construct our two player object with the names provided
  return a randomized player object and display as starting turn
}

endTurn {
  will be called by play() when die rolls return 1 and turnScore = 0
    turnScore += overallScore
  will be called by hold() when activated and turnScore != 0
    turnScore += overallScore
  in both cases, turn ends and "currentPlayer" changes to other player, we can make that change in this behavior and display in browser
  return currentPlayer;
}

end game {
  checks player's total score
  if player to hit 100 or more wins
}
